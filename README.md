# Cli-Expense-Tracker

## Overview
This project is a simple command-line tool which allows the user to track their expenses. It will include date, category, cost and this data will be written to a CSV database The program will feature a CLI menu which allows the user to either add a new record or read the existing records.

## Features
- Add new expenses
- Output current recorded expenses
- View total spending

## Motivation for the project
I created this project as a way for myself to practice the fundamentals of python, including file handling by using context managers (with the with statement) and writing to CSV files. It also allowed me to gain a small amount of experience in structuring a small but functional program. I also tried to add more comments in my work where they were necessary, as this is a good habit to get into for future larger projects and potientially working in this field.

## What I learned
- How to write to CSV files
- How to use context managers as a more efficient way to handle files
- How to handle user input safely (validation)

## Future improvements
- Monthly summaries
- Comparing total monthly cost with monthly income
- Ability to delete or modify previous records
- GUI version with simple graphs (perhaps graphs totalling the user's spending on certain categories per month?)
